# Projects

This page contains only content that has the tag **project**.

This works thanks to this code:

```jsx
<FeedItems filterByTags={['project']} />
```

More about the `FeedItems` component in the docs: [gatsby-theme-chronoblog#feeditems-component](https://github.com/Chronoblog/gatsby-theme-chronoblog#feeditems-component)

This is convenient for creating pages with your works, portfolio, collecting articles of a certain subject in one place, etc.

If you do not need an extra page, just remove it from `src/pages/`, and remove link to this page from the main menu: `src/gatsby-theme-chronoblog/site-header.mdx`.

More about the additional site pages in the docs: [gatsby-theme-chronoblog#pages](https://github.com/Chronoblog/gatsby-theme-chronoblog#pages)

## Projects (any content with the "project" tag):

<FeedItems filterByTags={['project']} />
