Back in early 2013, I was working at a small startup in San Francisco called Stitch Fix, alongside Adam Morse and a handful of others. We were designing and building out early versions of their marketing pages and some internal tools.

I had the word designer in my title, and until that point in my career, I'd not shipped much production code for work. I learned Flash in college and taught myself HTML and CSS on the side over the years, using it for small side projects and design prototypes for user research, but had never used Git and knew next-to-nothing about JavaScript.

We were both enamored by the work that people like Nicole Sullivan and Nicolas Gallagher were doing with Object-Oriented CSS and stealing lots of ideas for what we were working on.

```bash
bash command test
```

I learned Flash in college and taught myself HTML and CSS on the side over the years, using it for small side projects and design prototypes for user research, but had never used Git and knew next-to-nothing about JavaScript.

```js
const someFun = (text) => {
  console.log('some ' + text);
};
//
someFun('text');
//
```

After we left the company, I decided to move back to the east coast and work for Kickstarter.

```css
/* example in CSS */
.thing {
  font-size: 16px;
  width: 100%;
}
@media screen and (min-width: 40em) {
  font-size: 20px;
  width: 50%;
}
@media screen and (min-width: 52em) {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

```jsx
// example with Styled System
<Thing fontSize={[16, 20, 24]} width={[1, 1 / 2]} />
```

In late 2013, I'd taken some of the ideas Adam and I were talking about at the time, and some of the problems we were working on at Kickstarter (involving a 1MB+ CSS bundle), and released the first version of Basscss.

Around the same time, Adam released Tachyons. We both continued to develop each project separately and never landed on a common API for the two libraries.
